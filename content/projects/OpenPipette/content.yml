  items:
    - title: "40% cost reduction"
      description: "Our open-source designs eliminate proprietary markups, reducing pipette costs from thousands to hundreds of dollars. This makes critical lab equipment accessible to underfunded research and healthcare facilities."
    - title: "Fully open source"
      description: "Every design file, firmware, and validation protocol is publicly available. Labs can verify, modify, and manufacture pipettes independently—no vendor lock-in, complete transparency."
    - title: "Lab-validated accuracy"
      description: "Rigorous gravimetric and dye-based testing ensures our pipettes meet or exceed commercial accuracy standards. All validation data is published for peer review."
