# Project Overview

## Mission

OpenPipette aims to develop open-source, affordable medical pipetting devices that can save lives, especially when they're affordable.

## Goals

- Create validated, open-source pipettes
- Reduce costs to approximately 10% of commercial alternatives
- Enable labs and clinics everywhere to access reliable tools
- Release all CAD, firmware, and validation protocols openly

## Current Status

**Phase:** Planning

We are currently in the planning phase, working on:
- Design specifications
- Validation protocols
- Prototype planning

## Target Specifications

- 96-channel validated prototype
- Modular handheld units (1, 8, 12, 16 channels)
- Open designs on GitHub
- Validated accuracy with publishable results

## Team

- **Lead:** Mathijs Follon (Informatica)
- **Co-lead:** Niels Staes (Industrial Engineering)
